# lottry-Game
A simple but intense web-based lottery game built with vanilla JavaScript. Players pick their lucky box and the game uses Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate a random winning number behind the scenes. The lottery boxes are created dynamically with JavaScript, and animations plus sound effects add tension while the result is revealed.
